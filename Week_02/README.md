## Lab Manual Outline

The course is structured around a progressive lab manual that introduces **SystemVerilog-based Digital Design** concepts and FPGA synthesis methodology. The labs (the lab manual is attached [here]([url](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OXFfLt3pLThsZbMhK5p9150xLZNFo4R9T_oMhC6NobY/edit?usp=sharing))) are divided into **combinational, sequential, FSM, interface, and integration-based designs**.
